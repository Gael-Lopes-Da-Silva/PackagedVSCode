### Keybinded is a simple keybinding based on the ALT key. It take inspiration of some keybindings from vim and helix.

### If you have suggestions, fell free to report it [here](https://github.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/KeybindedVSCode/issues/new/choose). This would help me a lot.

## How to build ?
If you want a build of Yellowed you can find it in the release section or in the [build](./build/) folder. Else use `vsce package` in the project folder.

## How to install ?
To install, open visual studio code and go to the extention menu. Click on the three dots and click on `Install from VSIX` and choose the `packaged-X.X.X.vsix` file. Or just install it on the market place.
